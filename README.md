# Project Title

COVID-19 Regional Analysis

# Description

Using a collection of Data sets relating to COVID-19 me and my peers used 4 distinct approaches to analyze the information in order to extract relevant 
corelations. Each generated plot seeks to aid in answering 4 distinct questions that relate to the handling and policy decisions for handling the COVID-19 pandemic. 

Question 1) What percentage of each vaccination group in the Ontario population got admitted to ICU?

Vaccination Groups: 
* Partially Vaccinated
* Fully Vaccinated (2 shots at this time)
